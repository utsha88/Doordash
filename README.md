Take-home project for prospective iOS devs!


Background
--------------------------
At DoorDash, we allow customers to order delivery from their favorite local restaurants. For this exercise, you will be building a ‘lite’ version of DoorDash. Users will be able to pick a location on a Map, and view a list of nearby stores.

We expect this project to take between 2-4 hours.

Requirements
--------------------------
1. Users can select a location by dragging a Map
2. Users can browse a list of stores available to the location selected previously
3. Show us how you would test it thoroughly.

Design
--------------------------
Find the design spec located in the _DesignSpec_ directory in this repo. You should try to implement to spec! This means colors, assets, layout, etc.

The design contains a tab bar on the bottom with a disabled second button. We'd like you to add this piece as well.

Other Notes
--------------------------
As much as reasonable, you ought to treat this project like it is a production app. Modularize your code, test when appropriate, comment if necessary, etc.

Also feel free to pull in libraries (AFNetworking, FLKAutoLayout, etc) as you see fit. For dependency management, please use cocoapods or carthage.

When You're Done
--------------------------
Zip up the entire project directory and send it back. Thanks for your hard work!
